# Day 16: Sampling & Sample Size

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Larger samples lead to more reliable estimates.
- Sample means vary more when the sample is small.
- The true population mean is better approximated as sample size increases.

## 🎮 Game Analogy
I simulated the average DPS of Wuthering Waves Rover builds.
Even though the data was skewed, the sample mean stabilized with larger sample sizes.

## 🔢 Sample Sizes Tested
- 5, 10, 30, 100, 500

## 📈 Observations
- Small `n` = wide spread = unstable mean
- Large `n` = tight spread = accurate estimate
- Sampling is essential when full data isn’t available

## ✅ Status: Completed
