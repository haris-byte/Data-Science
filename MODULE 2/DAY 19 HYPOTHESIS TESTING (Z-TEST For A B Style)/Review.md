# DAY 19 HYPOTHESIS TESTING (Z-TEST)

- a method to make decisions or inferences about population parameters.
## Null & Alternate Hypothesis
- In simple Null means the value have no effect & alternative mean the value increase the mean
## z-Score
- It tells how far the value is from mean in std, As if std is 1 value is one std above the average
- Z = 3 means sample mean is 3 standard deviations away from population mean.
- z_score = (sample_mean - pop_mean) / (pop_std / (n ** 0.5))
## P-Value
- P-Value: Probability of seeing your data (or more extreme) if H₀ is true.
- P-value < α (e.g., 0.05): Reject H₀ (evidence supports H₁, change likely).
- P-value ≥ α: Fail to reject H₀ (no strong evidence of change).
## 5. Weapon Recommendation (Emerald of Genesis)
- Based on the test (p-value < 0.05), I recommend equipping Emerald of Genesis for Rover because it significantly boosts damage output
