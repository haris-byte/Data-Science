# Day 18: Confidence Intervals

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Confidence Intervals show the uncertainty around sample estimates.
- 95% CI means if I repeated the sampling 100 times, 95 of the intervals would capture the true mean.
- Wider intervals = more uncertainty (small sample, high std)
- Narrower intervals = more confidence

## 🎮 Game Analogy
Estimated average DPS from Rover builds.
Used CI to check how far off my sample might be from the true population mean.

## ✅ Code
- Calculated 95% CI from one sample
- Plotted 50 CIs to visualize how often the true mean was inside the range

## ✅ Status: Completed
