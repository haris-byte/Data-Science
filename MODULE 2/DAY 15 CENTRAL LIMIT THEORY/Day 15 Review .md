# Day 15: Central Limit Theorem (CLT)

## 🔍 What I learned
- CLT is the reason we can trust sample means.
- No matter how skewed or weird the data is, the sample means tend to be normally distributed.
- This allows us to do powerful inference even without perfect data.

## 🧪 Summary
- Used exponential (skewed) data
- Took 1000 samples of 30 values each
- Plotted original vs sample means
- Sample means formed a bell curve ✅

## 📈 Real-world use
CLT powers:
- Confidence Intervals
- A/B Testing
- Polling
- ML Model Evaluation

## ✅ Status: Completed
