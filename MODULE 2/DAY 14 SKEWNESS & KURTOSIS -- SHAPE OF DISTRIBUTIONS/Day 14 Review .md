# Day 14: Skewness & Kurtosis

## ðŸ“Š Concepts Covered
- **Skewness** measures asymmetry of data.
- **Kurtosis** measures tailedness (sharpness/outliers).

## ðŸ§  Intuition
- A positive skew means long right tail (e.g., income data).
- A high kurtosis means more outliers (e.g., stock returns).

## ðŸ§ª Summary of Stats
- Normal Skew: [your result]
- Normal Kurtosis: [your result]
- Skewed Skew: [your result]
- Skewed Kurtosis: [your result]

## ðŸ“ˆ Plots
- Plotted Normal vs Right-Skewed distributions
- Used `matplotlib` + `scipy.stats`

## ðŸ’¡ Real-world Application
These shape insights help us detect:
- Outliers (via kurtosis)
- Bias in data (via skewness)
