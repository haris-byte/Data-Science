# ðŸ‘‰ If you measure heights of people, IQ scores, errors in measurement, test scores in a big population:
# âœ… Most values cluster around the average (mean).
# âœ… Few values are much lower or higher.

# Mean (Î¼) â†’ center.
# Standard deviation (Ïƒ) â†’ width (spread).

# A Gaussian (Normal) distribution means:
# most data is around the average, fewer data points are far away, forming a bell curve.
