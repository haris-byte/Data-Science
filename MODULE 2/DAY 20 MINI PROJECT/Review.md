# Day 20 Mini Project: Analysis of New Weapon for Change in Dps

Asuming Weapon Echo_Sabar Released in Fictional RPG wuthering Wavws.
Analysing Dps Performance Test By:
- Confidence Interval (95%)
- Hypothesis Testing (Z-Test)

## Scenario Given:
- A new weapon called “Echo Saber-X” is said to increase DPS. You’re given simulated data to test if this weapon actually performs better than the population average DPS of 2000.

## Tests
1. Taken Confidence Interval of Echo-Sabar DPS (Damage Per Second)
- My Data is between X(Low) and Y(High) then im 95% Sure Weapon is Recomended to Use else not
2. Apply Hypothesis Testing (z-test, one tailed)
- if signicant value 0.05 is lower then p-value accept Null Hopthesis as no Evidence for better porfomancr
- Significant Value 0.05 is higher then p-value reject Null Hypothesis Weapon is recomended 

## Test Results
- CI = 2066 - 2212
- p = 0.00004
- the weapon is recomended as it increases the DPS 
- Echo Sabar Mean 2139.5642978070014 > Population Mean 1994.2205247975703
