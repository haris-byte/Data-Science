# Day 23 - Paired t-Test: DPS Before vs After Using "Crimson Star"

## Scenario:
We tested whether equipping the new artifact **Crimson Star** significantly improves DPS for the *same character* by comparing damage output **before and after** equipping.

## Concepts:
- **Paired t-Test** is used when two measurements are from the same source (e.g., same player, different conditions).
- Hypothesis:
  - **H₀:** No DPS improvement (mean_before ≈ mean_after)
  - **H₁:** DPS improves after equipping Crimson Star

## Result:
- **Mean Before:** 1950±250  
- **Mean After:** ~2070  
- **p-value:** < 0.05 → Significant Improvement

## Conclusion:
Crimson Star significantly boosts DPS for Rover and is a recommended upgrade.
