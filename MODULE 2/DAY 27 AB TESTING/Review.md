# Day 27 – A/B Testing: Real Business UI Click Analysis

## Concept:
A/B testing compares two versions (A vs B) to see which performs better.  
We applied it on an e-commerce case: testing a new homepage layout’s effect on clicks.

## Method:
Used a Chi-Square test on categorical data (clicked vs not clicked).  
Compared observed clicks for old vs new design.

## Result:
- Old Clicks: 60/400
- New Clicks: 90/380
- p-value < 0.05 ⇒ New design significantly improved click rate

## Real-World Use:
Common in product testing, marketing experiments, UX design.  
Used both in websites and games to drive data-backed decisions.
