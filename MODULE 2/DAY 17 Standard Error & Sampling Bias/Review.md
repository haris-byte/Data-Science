# Day 17: Standard Error & Sampling Bias

## 🔍 What I Learned
- Standard Error shows how much sample means vary.
- SE drops as sample size increases → more stable estimate.
- Sampling Bias happens when the sample is not representative.

## 🎮 Game Analogy
Simulated DPS from Wuthering Waves players.
Biased sample (only high DPS players) gave misleading results.
Larger, random samples had lower SE → more trustworthy.

## 📈 Observations
- SE at n=10 → high
- SE at n=500 → very low
- Biased sample mean ≠ true mean

## ✅ Status: Completed
