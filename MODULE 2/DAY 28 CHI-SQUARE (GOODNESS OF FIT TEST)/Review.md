# Day 28 Chi Square Goodness of Fit Test

## Scenarios given:
we analyzed the Observed Gacha drop rate matched the expected drop rate given by the Developers

## Concept:
- Chi Sequre GOF checks weather the frequence distribution of abserved matches the expected distribution 
- H0: Observed = Expected (No Significant Change)
- H1: Observed â‰  Expected (Significant Change Do not match)

## Results:
Observed: [3, 22, 75]
Expected: [5, 15, 80]
P-Value: 0.11 < 0.05 -> (So Accept the Null Hypothesis)
Chi2: 4.38

## Conclusion:
The Observed Drop Rate is significanlty not Equal to Expected AS we Accept Null Hypothesis.
